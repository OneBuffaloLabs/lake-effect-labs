</p>

A functional, side-mounted organizer designed specifically for the **Official Creality K2 SE/K1 SE Enclosure**. This holder utilizes the pre-drilled mounting points on the transparent PC panels to keep your entire essential toolkit organized and accessible.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `k2-se-tool-holder.scad` — The core parametric OpenSCAD model.
* `k2-se-tool-holder.stl` — The exported print-ready file.
* `k2-se-tool-holder.3mf` — Multi-plate project file with optimized slicer settings.
* `images/`
* `README.md` — This file.

## 🛠 Required Hardware & Compatibility

**🚨 IMPORTANT:** The stock K2 SE does not have an enclosure. This mod **will not fit** without the official accessory:

* **Required Enclosure:** [Creality Official K2 SE/K1 SE Transparent PC Enclosure](https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Transparent-Temperature-Protective-Customized/dp/B0FSQFJHZ1)
* **Mounting Spacing:** Precision-modeled for a hole-to-hole center distance of **110.63 mm**.
* **Hardware:** 2x M4 screws (designed to thread into the existing enclosure holes).

## 🛠 Print Instructions

### Slicer Settings

* **Material:** PLA (stiff) or PETG (durable/slight flex).
* **Layer Height:** 0.2mm.
* **Wall Loops:** **4–5 loops**. Since this holds weight, wall thickness is more important than infill.
* **Wall Generator:** **Arachne** is required to ensure the tool slot tolerances are crisp.
* **Infill:** 25% Gyroid.
* **Supports:** **REQUIRED**. Use **Tree (Organic) Supports** to support the hanging glue stick and grease cups. Tree supports are recommended as they are easy to remove and leave a cleaner finish on the undersides of the cups.

## 🔧 Tool Compatibility

This holder is custom-sized for the standard toolkit and maintenance items provided with the K2 SE:

* **Glue Stick & Mechanical Grease:** Dedicated drop-in cups.
* **Wrench:** Slide-in front slot (15mm groove).
* **Scraper:** Wide 42mm rear slot.
* **Flush Cutters:** Dedicated center-back slot.
* **Front Access Tools:** L-Shaped Socket Wrench, Small Screwdriver, 3x Allen Keys (1.6mm, 2.5mm, 3mm), and Nozzle Cleaning Tool.
* **Flash Drive:** Sized to catch the plastic housing while the metal plug drops through.
* **Accessory Hook:** 8mm wide hook for 11mm+ diameter items (like calipers or nozzle brushes).

*Note: This is an aftermarket modification. Ensure your screws are tight but do not over-torque them against the PC enclosure panels.*
