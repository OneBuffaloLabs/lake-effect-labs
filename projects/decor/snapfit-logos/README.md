# The SnapFit Collection: Professional Sports Logos

High-tolerance, multi-part 3D prints designed for a perfect friction fit. No glue, just precision plastic engineering.

This collection leverages the power of OpenSCAD to convert standard vector graphics into tight, snap-together physical objects. By utilizing built-in clearances and the natural thermal expansion of 3D printed plastics, these models lock together like puzzle pieces.

## 🧬 The "SnapFit" DNA (Universal Specs)

Instead of repeating these in every folder, here are the baseline rules that apply to **every** logo in this collection:

- **The Fit:** Designed with a default `0.15mm` clearance.
- **The Layer:** Optimized for `0.2mm` layer height.
- **The Walls:** Requires the **Arachne** wall generator in your slicer (preserves tiny, sharp details like animal horns or text).
- **The Look:** Designed to be printed with **Concentric** top surface patterns to make the filament lines follow the flow of the logo.
- **The Squish:** _Elephant Foot Compensation_ must be set (usually between 0.15mm - 0.2mm) so the first layer doesn't bulge and ruin the tolerances.

## 🛠 Collection-Wide Assembly Tips

- **The Surface:** Always assemble on a flat, hard, and sturdy surface.
- **The Temperature:** Let parts cool _completely_ on the build plate before snapping them together. Warm PLA is soft and will deform if forced.
- **The "Click":** Press firmly with the flat of your thumb. You should feel a satisfying tactile "click" when the insert bottoms out in the pocket.
