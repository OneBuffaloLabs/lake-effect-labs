## 🖨️ Recommended Print Settings

To get the best results, especially if this is a functional part, we recommend the following settings:

- **Material:** [e.g., PETG or ABS recommended for outdoor use]
- **Layer Height:** [e.g., 0.2mm]
- **Infill:** [e.g., 15% Gyroid]
- **Wall Loops (Perimeters):** [e.g., 3-4 for extra strength]
- **Supports:** [e.g., None required / Tree supports on build plate only]
- **Brim:** [e.g., Not necessary unless you have warping issues]

## 🔩 Hardware Required

_If your model snaps together, just write "100% 3D Printed - No extra hardware needed!" If it needs screws, list them here:_

- [e.g., 4x M3x12mm Socket Head Screws]
- [e.g., 4x M3 Heat Set Inserts]

## 🛠️ Customizing with OpenSCAD

Because this design is parametric, you can easily adjust the dimensions to fit your specific needs using the included `.scad` file.

**Key Variables You Can Change:**

- `width` - Adjusts the overall width (Default: 50mm)
- `tolerance` - Increase this if your printer runs a bit tight (Default: 0.2mm)

_To modify, simply open the file in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), change the variables at the top of the script, press `F6` to render, and `F7` to export your new STL._

## 🧩 Assembly Instructions

1. [Step 1: e.g., Press the heat-set inserts into the base.]
2. [Step 2: e.g., Align the top cover and secure with the M3 screws.]
3. [Step 3: e.g., Enjoy!]
